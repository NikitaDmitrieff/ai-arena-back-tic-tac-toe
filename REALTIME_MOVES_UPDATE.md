# Real-Time Move Display Update

## Overview
Updated the frontend to display LLM moves in real-time as they happen, rather than showing only the final result at the end of the game.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Modified `playAuto()` Function**
- **Before**: Called `/games/{game_id}/auto` endpoint which played the entire game on the backend and returned only the final result
- **After**: Calls `/games/{game_id}/move` endpoint repeatedly in a loop, displaying each move as it happens

**Key improvements:**
- Each move is visible immediately on the board
- Move counter updates in real-time
- Configurable delay between moves (0.5s to 3s)
- Shows player thinking status
- Displays LLM reasoning for each move (if available)

### 2. **Added Move History Log**
A new section that displays a chronological log of all moves with:
- Player indicator (color-coded for X and O)
- Move coordinates (row, col)
- LLM reasoning/thinking process (if provided by the backend)
- Response time for each move (if available)
- Smooth slide-in animation for each new entry

**Visual features:**
- Red border for Player X moves
- Blue border for Player O moves
- Scrollable log (max height: 400px)
- Most recent move appears at the top

### 3. **Added Configurable Delay Control**
A dropdown selector allowing users to adjust the delay between moves:
- 0.5 seconds (fast)
- 1 second (default)
- 1.5 seconds
- 2 seconds
- 3 seconds (slow)

This lets you control the pace at which you watch the game unfold.

### 4. **Enhanced Move Display**
- Shows current player's move coordinates in the info section
- Displays LLM reasoning inline if available
- Updates board state after each move
- Game statistics update in real-time

## How It Works

### Sequential Move Execution Flow:
```
1. User clicks "⚡ Play Auto"
2. Frontend enters loop (while game not over):
   a. Display "Player thinking..." message
   b. Call POST /games/{game_id}/move with empty body
   c. Receive move response from backend
   d. Update board visually
   e. Add move to history log with reasoning
   f. Update game statistics
   g. Wait for configured delay (0.5s - 3s)
   h. Repeat if game not over
3. Display final result (winner or draw)
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Watch the game unfold move-by-move rather than seeing just the final state
2. **Educational**: See the LLM's reasoning process for each move
3. **Debugging**: Easier to spot where strategies succeed or fail
4. **Engagement**: More entertaining to watch the battle between LLMs
5. **Transparency**: Full visibility into response times and decision-making

## No Backend Changes Required

This implementation works with the existing backend API - no modifications needed!
- Uses the existing `/games/{game_id}/move` endpoint
- Compatible with all current player configurations
- Works with both LLM and random players

## Usage

1. **Configure players** (LLM or random)
2. **Create a game**
3. **Click "⚡ Play Auto"**
4. **Watch the moves happen in real-time!**
5. **Adjust the delay** if moves are too fast/slow
6. **Review move history** to see reasoning and decisions

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add pause/resume functionality during auto-play
- Export move history to CSV/JSON
- Add move-by-move replay feature
- Highlight winning combinations
- Show board evaluation scores (if LLM provides them)
- Add sound effects for moves
- Implement keyboard shortcuts (space to pause, arrow keys to adjust speed)

## Technical Notes

- Move log automatically clears when creating a new game or resetting
- Move history is scrollable for games with many moves
- Animations are CSS-based for smooth performance
- Compatible with all modern browsers
